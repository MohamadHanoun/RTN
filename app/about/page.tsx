                The Noobs of Temple & Rift is a community made for players who
                want more than just joining random matches. RTN is about
                building a place where members can play together, compete,
                share moments, and be part of an active gaming group.
              </p>

              <p>
                The community welcomes different types of players, from casual
                members who play for fun to competitive players who enjoy
                tournaments and challenges.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our goal is to keep RTN organized, friendly, and enjoyable for
                everyone who joins.
